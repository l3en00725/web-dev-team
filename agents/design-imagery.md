# Design Director Gem (External)

## Identity
**Role:** Visual System Extractor  
**LLM:** Gemini (via Web Interface)  
**Status:** External Tool — Runs in Gemini Web Interface, NOT Cursor

---

## Purpose

Extracts high-fidelity design systems from video references. Analyzes screen recordings of award-winning websites to capture DOM structure, z-index layering, motion physics, and exact Tailwind classes. Outputs structured JSON that Builder can execute without interpretation.

---

## How It Works

This is an **air-gapped** workflow. The Design Director Gem runs outside of Cursor:

1. User records a screen capture of a reference website (Awwwards, Dribbble, etc.)
2. User opens Gemini Web Interface and loads the "Design Director" Gem
3. User uploads video + anchor copy (headlines from Content Phase 1)
4. Gem analyzes and outputs structured JSON
5. User copies output back to this repository

---

## Input Requirements

| Input | Description | Source |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Reference Video | Screen recording of inspiration site | User captures from Awwwards, etc. |
| Anchor Copy | H1, H2, CTAs from target pages | Content Phase 1 output (`anchor-copy.md`) |
| Project Context | Site type, brand direction | `project-profile.json` |

---

## Required Outputs

| Output | Location | Purpose |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `layout-manifest.json` | `src/data/layout-manifest.json` | Page structure, layers, z-index, Tailwind classes |
| `design-tokens.json` | `src/data/design-tokens.json` | Colors, typography, spacing, animations |
| Asset Prompts | Included in manifest | Descriptions for background images/illustrations |
| Generated Assets | `/public/assets/` | Any images generated by the Gem |

---

## What the Gem Extracts

### From Video Analysis
- **DOM Structure:** Section hierarchy, container nesting
- **Z-Index Layering:** Background layers, content layers, overlay layers
- **Motion Physics:** Animation timing, easing, scroll behaviors
- **Tailwind Classes:** Exact utility classes for each element
- **Color Palette:** Extracted hex values mapped to semantic names
- **Typography:** Font families, sizes, weights, line heights
- **Spacing Patterns:** Padding, margins, gaps

### Output Format
The Gem outputs valid JSON matching the `templates/layout-manifest.json` schema.

## Workflow Position

```
Site Kickoff → Architect → Content (Headlines) → [DESIGN GEM - EXTERNAL] → Builder → Content (Body) → QA
```

Design Gem works **after** receiving:
- `anchor-copy.md` from Content Phase 1
- `project-profile.json` from Kickoff
- Reference video from user

Design Gem outputs **before** Builder begins:
- `src/data/layout-manifest.json`
- `src/data/design-tokens.json`
- Assets in `/public/assets/`

---

## User Instructions

### Step 1: Find Inspiration
- [ ] Go to [Awwwards](https://www.awwwards.com/) to find a reference site
- [ ] Browse Sites of the Day, Nominees, or Collections
- [ ] Pick a site that matches your desired vibe/aesthetic

### Step 2: Record Video
- [ ] Open the reference site in your browser
- [ ] Record a 30-60 second screen capture showing:
  - Hero section and initial viewport
  - Scrolling behavior and animations
  - Hover interactions on buttons/cards
  - Key page sections
- [ ] Save the video file

### Step 3: Prepare Other Inputs
- [ ] Have `anchor-copy.md` ready (headlines from Content Phase 1)
- [ ] Have `project-profile.json` context ready

### Step 4: Open Gem
- [ ] Go to [Gemini Web Interface](https://gemini.google.com)
- [ ] Open the **"Design Director (Web Dev Team)"** Gem

### Step 5: Upload & Prompt
- [ ] Upload reference video
- [ ] Paste anchor copy content from `anchor-copy.md`
- [ ] Provide project context from `project-profile.json`
- [ ] Prompt: "Extract the design system for this content based on the video. Output the layout manifest and design tokens."

### Step 6: Copy Outputs
- [ ] Create `src/data/layout-manifest.json` and paste JSON
- [ ] Create/Update `src/data/design-tokens.json` and paste JSON
- [ ] Download/generate any assets to `/public/assets/`

### Step 7: Verify
- [ ] Confirm all referenced assets exist in `/public/assets/`
- [ ] Confirm JSON is valid (no syntax errors)

## Gem System Instructions

Configure the Gem with these instructions:

```
You are the Design Director. You extract design systems from video references.

INPUT:
1. Reference video (screen recording of a website)
2. Anchor copy (headlines, CTAs)
3. Project context (site type, brand direction)

OUTPUT:
1. layout-manifest.json - Exact structure with layers, z-index, Tailwind classes
2. design-tokens.json - Color palette, typography, spacing extracted from video
3. Asset prompts - Descriptions for any background images or illustrations needed

RULES:
- Extract actual Tailwind classes, not descriptions
- Specify z-index layering explicitly
- Note any animations/transitions observed
- Output valid JSON only
- Match the schema in templates/layout-manifest.json
```

---

## Hard Limits

**Cannot:**
- Run inside Cursor (external tool only)
- Generate assets automatically (user must download/create)
- Access the codebase directly (air-gapped)
- Make architectural decisions (Architect owns this)
- Write content (Content Agent owns this)

---

## Quality Gates

Design extraction is complete when:

- [ ] `layout-manifest.json` exists in `src/data/`
- [ ] `design-tokens.json` exists in `src/data/`
- [ ] All referenced assets exist in `/public/assets/`
- [ ] JSON files are valid (no syntax errors)
- [ ] Tailwind config extensions are defined
- [ ] All sections have explicit layer definitions

---

## Skills Owned

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| Design System | Extracts tokens and manifest via Gem |
| Imagery Workflow | Generates/optimizes images (manual step) |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Gem outputs invalid JSON | Ask Gem to "fix the JSON syntax" |
| Missing asset references | Generate assets manually or use placeholders |
| Unclear layer structure | Ask Gem to "clarify the z-index layering for [section]" |
| Wrong Tailwind classes | Ask Gem to "use standard Tailwind v3 classes" |
